**Note: Vase mode with a brim is required. This also hollows out the top so that a label can be slipped in.**

A customizable clone of the plastic trays provided with MD's Halo True/Clear switches. The trays keep the switches nicely organized.

The 154mm STL matches the black stock trays, but make any length you want with the Customizer (or by loading the .scad file into a local OpenSCAD installation).

Note: These flex and fit a bit tightly on purpose, so that the switches don't fall out when flipped upside-down.

Filament used in photos:

Printing style: 

0.2mm layers with Slic3rPE in vase mode
