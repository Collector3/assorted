# v2

v2 takes forward some lessons learned from having v1 in use (the peg that inserts into the metal tubing is a bit short).
The squareish cutaway is also removed, to avoid having to use supports for printing.

~~As of 2019-08-31, this isn't tested and/or printed yet, so YMMV.~~ v2 works pretty well!
