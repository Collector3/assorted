# ikea-galant-endcap

A endcap designed to have things hanging off of it.

The metal tubes on the Ikea Galant desk are pretty sturdy, so this print replaces and extends the grey endcaps. I'm using this
to keep a small Makita power drill off of the floor (the belt hook slots into place quite well).

Maybe you'll find a use for this too?
