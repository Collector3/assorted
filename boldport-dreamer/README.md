# Boldport Dreamer Frame

This is a 3d printable press-fit frame for [Boldport's Dreamer PCB art](https://www.boldport.com/products/dreamer/).

V2 has a stand now, and is attached with an M3 (or epoxy/hot glue, artist/assembler's choice)

### Details

* The frame+stand hole takes an M3 (CAD: 2.85mm in diameter, with a depth of 6.5mm--stand included). 

* Preferred screw size: [M3 x 6mm](https://www.trimcraftaviationrc.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=244) (or shorter depth). With a 0.4mm nozzle (and associated slicer settings), a small
slot will be visible that shows how deep the screw is embedded. Don't overtighten/bottom out; an impression of the screw will show on the
frame's face.

For tapping, or printer weirdness, the STEP files are provided. The tap size for an M3 is around 2.50mm.
