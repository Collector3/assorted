# plates

This is an Adafruit Metro + 16-channel servo/pwm driver plate

The Metro takes M3 screws, and the 16-channel servo/pwm driver takes M2.5 screws. [Plastic spacers](https://github.com/Collector3/magnetic-feather/blob/master/stls/feather-m2.5-plastic-spacer.stl) are be needed to avoid scratching the soldermask.

Spacers appropriate for M2.5s can be found in the [magnetic feather project folder](https://github.com/Collector3/magnetic-feather/tree/master/stls)
