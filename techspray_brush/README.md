# Techspray Brush

![Techspray with a printed brush cap](techspray_brush/techspray-brush.png)

This is a cap for the end of a techspray brush available through Mouser. Part number: [577-2033](http://www.mouser.com/access/?pn=577-2033)

The brush's end is open, so I was afraid all kinds of gunk would get in, being left on a bench. The cap is designed in
[OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org/). Feel free to copy/paste and play around with it; its pretty simple.
